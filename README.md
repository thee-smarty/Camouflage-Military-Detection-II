## Title
Snow Camouflage Military Soldier Detection and Segmentation using Dense De-Convolutional Networks

## Abstract
Snow camouflage is the use of a coloration or pattern for effective camouflage used by armed forces to conceal personnel, equipment, and installations from observation by enemy forces in snow fields. The primary objectives of snow camouflage are to avoid detection, to deceive or confuse adversaries about the location or intentions of military assets, and to enhance survivability on the snow battlefields. This project aims to address the challenge of detecting and segmentation of military personnel using deep learning techniques, through the utilization of Dense Deconvolution Networks (DDNs), an advanced variant of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project entails the collection of a diverse dataset comprising images containing snow camouflaged military soldiers against various backgrounds. The DDN architecture is designed to effectively capture spatial hierarchies and feature representations within the input images, enabling the identification of camouflaged individuals with high precision through Binary segmentation. By leveraging dense connections of deconvolutional layers, the DDN model can efficiently reconstruct spatial information lost during down-sampling operations, thus enhancing the fidelity of detection outcomes.
