## Title
Camouflaged Military Soldier Segmentation Using Swin Transformers

## Abstract
Military camouflage employs advanced techniques and patterns to conceal personnel, equipment, and installations from enemy observation, aiming to avoid detection, mislead adversaries regarding the location or intentions of military assets, and increase battlefield survivability. This project addresses the challenge of detecting camouflaged military personnel through the application of Swin Transformers, a state-of-the-art architecture leveraging hierarchical vision transformers. The project involves assembling a comprehensive dataset featuring camouflaged soldiers in various environments. Swin Transformer (Shifted Window Transformer) are utilized for their capability to capture both local and global context through their hierarchical structure and shifted window mechanism, which enhances their ability to detect camouflaged individuals with high accuracy. By integrating multi-scale feature extraction and long-range dependency handling, the Swin Transformer model improves the precision of binary segmentation tasks, thereby advancing the effectiveness of camouflage detection.
